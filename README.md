# Feedback Central Docs

### Based on Supabase
The docs are actually based upon Supabase's, this has been done to save time when the were made in the 10 day hackathon. Eventually we would aim to switch these over to our own style but for now the Supabase's style looks lovely.

If you want to check out the original docs look at their [repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/web).
